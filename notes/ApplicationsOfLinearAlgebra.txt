LINEAR ALGEBRA
    -One of the main building blocks of ML
    -Study of vectors, matrices, and linear functions

Applications of LINEAR ALGEBRA in ML
    -Data set and Data Files
        -Either a matrix or a vectors
    -Images and Photographs
    -Data Preparation
        -Dimensionality reduction 
            -Data sets are represented as matrices
            -Use Matrix factorization methods to reduce it into its constituent parts
        -One hot encoding
            -Used when working with categorical data 
                -ex: As the class labels for classification problems, or categorical input variables
    -Linear Regression
        -For predicting numerical values in simpler regression problems
        -The most common way of solving linear regression is via a least squares optimization
    -Regularization
        -Used to prevent a model from overfitting
        -Often used to encourage a model to minimize the size of coefficients while it is being fit on data 
    -Principal Component Analysis
        -Method for automatically reducing the number of columns of a data set
        -Used in ML to create projections of high-dimensional data for both visualization and training models
        -The core of PCA method is a matrix factorization method
    -Latent Semantic Analysis
        -Form of data preparation used in natural language, a subfield of ML for working with text data
        -Documents are usaully represented as a matrix of word occurrences
        -Apply matrix factorization methods to them in order to be able to easily compare, query, and use them as basis for ML model
    -Recommender Systems
        -Predictive modeling problems that involve the recommendation of products
        -Used in e-commerce, social media, and other systems that involve a user and a catalog of products
    -Deep Learning
        -Scaled up to multiple dimensions
        -Work with vectors, matrices, and tensors of inputs and coefficients
