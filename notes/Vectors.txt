VECTORS

A Scalar is:
    -A number
    -Denoted with a lowercase symbol, such as a or b
    -ex: weight, temperature, blood pressure

A Vector is:
    -An ordered list of numbers
    -Denoted with lowercase bolded roman letters, such as a or b
    -Some texts italics or print an arrow over the letter
    -ex: position, velocity, acceleration

Vector Characteristics:
    -Dimensionality: the number of elements in a vector
    -Orientation: column orentation (vertical) or row orientation (horizontal)

Examples of Vectors 
    -[1, 2, 3] is a 3-dimensional vector
    -[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is a 5-dimensional vector
    -[1, 2, 3]T is a 3-dimensional column vector
    -[1, 2, 3] is a 3-dimensional row vector

Orientation is important because the wrong orientation can lead to unexpected results or errors

Vector dimensionalaly is called the length or the shape of the vector in Python

By convention, vectors are column orientated

Transpose operation is used to change the orientation of a vector from row to column or column to row

The algebraic interpetation of a vector is an ordered list of numbers, but the geometric interpretation of a vector is a line with a direction

Vectors can be represented as a list or array

example of a row vector in JS:
    const v = [1, 2, 3]

example of a column vector in JS:
    const v = [
        [1],
        [2],
        [3]
    ]

Vector Arithmetic

Vector Addition:
    -Add the corresponding elements of the two vectors
    -Is only possible when the two vectors have the same dimensionality
    -ex: [1, 2, 3] + [1, 2, 3] = [2, 4, 6]

Vector Subtraction:
    -Subtract the corresponding elements of the two vectors
    -Is only possible when the two vectors have the same dimensionality
    -ex: [1, 2, 3] - [1, 2, 3] = [0, 0, 0]

Vector Scalar
    -Multiply or divide every element of the vector by the same scalar value
    -ex: [1, 2, 3] * 2 = [2, 4, 6]
    -ex: [1, 2, 3] / 2 = [0.5, 1, 1.5]

Vector Multiply
    -Multiply the corresponding elements of the two vectors
    -Is only possible when the two vectors have the same dimensionality
    -ex: [1, 2, 3] * [1, 2, 3] = [1, 4, 9]

Vector Divide
    -Divide the corresponding elements of the two vectors
    -Is only possible when the two vectors have the same dimensionality
    -ex: [1, 2, 3] / [1, 2, 3] = [1, 1, 1]

Vector Dot Product
    -Multiply the corresponding elements of the two vectors and sum the results
    -Is only possible when the two vectors have the same dimensionality
    -ex: [1, 2, 3] . [1, 2, 3] = 1 + 4 + 9 = 14

Vector Magnitude
    -Calculate the square root of the sum of the squared elements of the vector
    -ex: sqrt(1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(14) = 3.7416573867739413

Unit or Basis Vectors
    -A vector with one element set to 1 and all other elements set to 0
    -ex: [1, 0, 0]
    -ex: [0, 1, 0]
    -ex: [0, 0, 1]
    -Are linearly independent of each other
    -Span the whole space
    -Aren't unique

Spanning Set
    -A set of vectors that can be combined to create any vector in the space
    -ex: [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]
    -ex: [1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 6], [3, 6, 9]
    -ex: [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]
    -The set {v1, v2, ..., vn} is a spanning set for V if every vector in V can be written as a linear combination of v1, v2, ..., vn

Standard Basis Vectors 
    -Are orthonormal meaning they're orthogonal to each other
    -Can be represented as vectors e1=[1,0] and e2=[0,1]
    -Can be used to represent any vector in 2D space
